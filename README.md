# ProgrammingIntro
This repo is dedicated to an Intro to Programming course I took in college. I already had a good grip on programming and python before starting the course so it wasn't very necessary. This repo is moreso an archive and for other people's reference if they want it.

The code on this repo is open source and is intended for educational purposes and nothing more. You may use this code however you like but I claim no responsibility for anything that happens due to its use.
